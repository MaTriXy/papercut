Papercut
========

Keep your codebase simple.

  * Annotate parts of your code that shouldn't make it to production
  * Automatically fail your build
  * Remember to remove code you don't need

@RemoveThis and @Refactor
-----------

The `@RemoveThis` and `@Refactor` annotations can be used interchangeably, but a `@RemoveThis` will trigger a build failure by default, whereas a `@Refactor` will only trigger a warning.

```java
class TemporaryHack {
    @RemoveThis
    private static final boolean DEBUG = true;
}
```

```java
class ThingDoer {
    @RemoveThis(date = "2017-01-01", value = "After SOME_FEATURE has launched")
    private void someHackyMethod() {
		// Here there be monsters
    }
}
```

Your build will fail at compile time by default.

```
:app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac
/Users/stu/workspaces/TestApp/app/src/main/java/testing/TemporaryHack.java:10: error: STOP SHIP: @RemoveThis found at:
    private static final boolean DEBUG = true;
                                 ^
/Users/stu/workspaces/TestApp/app/src/main/java/testing/ThingDoer.java:12: error: @RemoveThis found with description 'After SOME_FEATURE has launched' at:
    private void someHackyMethod() {
                 ^
2 errors
:app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac FAILED
```

If you set the `stopShip` parameter to false in the annotation then you will only receive a warning. This matches the behavior of `Refactor`.

```java
@RemoveThis(value = "After SOME_FEATURE has launched", stopShip = false)
private void someHackyMethod() {
    //TODO FIXME
}
```

```
:app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac
/Users/stu/workspaces/TestApp/app/src/main/java/testing/SomeApplication.java:54: warning: @RemoveThis found with description 'After SOME_FEATURE has launched
    private void someHackyMethod() {
                 ^
1 warning
```

With a small modification to your build.gradle file you can use version codes or version names instead of dates in your annotations.

In the case of an Android app, you can pass your version code and name to Papercut using the configuration below.

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        versionCode 4
        versionName "0.4.0"
        javaCompileOptions {
            annotationProcessorOptions {
                arguments = ['versionCode': String.valueOf(defaultConfig.versionCode),
                             'versionName': defaultConfig.versionName]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The arguments must both be passed as strings. The `versionCode` will be passed to `Integer.parseInt()` and the `versionName` must match the [semantic versioning schema][2].

You can then use the `versionCode` or `versionName` parameters in your annotations as below.

```java
@Refactor(versionName = "0.4.0")
private void fetchSomethingRemote() {
    // Temporary hack, please remove
}
```

@Milestone
----------

You can define milestones by which you would like to refactor or remove code. When you reach a milestone just delete
the `@Milestone` annotated field. If you use constants as in the first example below then deleting the field
should cause your IDE to highlight the instances that referenced it. If you use plain strings in your `@RemoveThis` or
`@Refactor` annotations then they must match your defined `@Milestone`s exactly, as in the second example.

```java
public class Milestones {
    @Milestone("LOGIN_REDESIGN") public static final String LOGIN_REDESIGN = "LOGIN_REDESIGN";
    @Milestone("SOME_FEATURE") public static final String SOME_FEATURE = "SOME_FEATURE";
    @Milestone("VERSION_2") public static final String VERSION_2 = "VERSION_2";
}

public class ImportantThingDoer {
    @Refactor(milestone = Milestones.LOGIN_REDESIGN)
    private void onlyUsedByLoginScreen() {

    }

    @RemoveThis(milestone = "VERSION_2")
    public void callOldAPI() {

    }
}
```

Download
--------

```groovy
dependencies {
	compile: 'ie.stu:papercut-annotations:0.0.4'
	annotationProcessor: 'ie.stu:papercut-compiler:0.0.4'
}
```

To use Papercut only in release builds you can alter the annotationProcessor line to use `releaseAnnotationProcessor` or
`debugAnnotationProcessor` to suit your needs. Delaying the execution until you're trying to build your release version
may be lead to unexpected build failures.

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile: 'ie.stu:papercut-annotations:0.0.4'
    releaseAnnotationProcessor: 'ie.stu:papercut-compiler:0.0.4'
}
```
